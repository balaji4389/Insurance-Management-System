                of an amount to the person assured (or his nominee) on the happening of the event
                insured against. The contract is valid for payment of the insured amount during:
                The date of maturity, or Specified dates at periodic intervals, or Unfortunate death,
                if it occurs earlier. Among other things, the contract also provides for the payment
                of premium periodically to the Corporation by the policyholder. Life insurance is
                universally acknowledged to be an institution, which eliminates 'risk', substituting
                certainty for uncertainty and comes to the timely aid of the family in the unfortunate
                event of death of the breadwinner. By and large, life insurance is civilisation's
                partial solution to the problems caused by death. Life insurance, in short, is concerned
                with two hazards that stand across the life-path of every person.
